        <h2>Who WE Are</h2>
        <p>
          In a heartwarming journey, two kindergarten best friends, Hriti and
          Laxita, embarked on a skincare venture inspired by Hriti's father, a
          seasoned skincare expert. Fueled by their generational knowledge, they
          transformed their passion into a small business. Hriti's father shared
          his expertise, guiding the duo in formulating gentle and natural
          skincare solutions suitable for all ages. From whimsical product names
          to packaging, the young entrepreneurs infused their products with a
          touch of childhood joy. Through this endearing collaboration, Hriti
          and Laxita not only created effective skincare but also cherished a
          bond that transcended generations, proving that the beauty of
          friendship can bloom into something extraordinary.
